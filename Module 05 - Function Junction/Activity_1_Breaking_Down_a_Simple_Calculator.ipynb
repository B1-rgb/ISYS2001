        "\n",
        "The perform_calculation() function acts as a coordinator by receiving the operation choice and the two numbers from the user. It then calls the correct calculation function based on the operation choice and returns the result. This allows each operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) to be handled separately while still being integrated into the larger program.\n",

If the add() function isn't working correctly, for example, we can focus on that specific function rather than trying to debug a giant block of code. The modular approach makes it easier to test each part independently.\n",

It is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing its internal organisation—without changing its external behaviour. Refactoring improves non-functional attributes of software, including code readability and reduced complexity. This can improve maintainability and make it easier to extend your programme in the future. Although this terminology may seem advanced now, it will become useful as you progress and work with more complex code and AI responses.\n",
